We, therefore, ensure that testing, route-to-diagnosis and care is accurate, accessible and affordable. \nWe are excited to be the first to offer a 360-degree view into each individual womans health and will build on this exponentially to have an inclusive, comprehensive dataset of female pathologies, genetics and biomarkers, enabling ever-learning algorithms to aid remote research and innovation for diagnostics and care.\nWe are using deep learning to identify womens increased risk of fertility deterioration and to prompt clinicians to consider more intensive monitoring and interventions.\n\nWith at-home blood test, paired with bespoke testing, actionable advice and a route-to-care, we help women learn more about their own biology and plan accordingly.

      "bio": "Hi, I’m Kay. 👋 Previously in Marketing & Growth at Uber and Head of Marketing at a community w/ 3 million entrepreneurs on Instagram. Always believed growth comes from building a purpose-driven brand. Spent 1 year working for myself, now exploring my next move. Open to joining your team. \n\nAt 16 years old, I realized that most people around me didn’t have a growth mindset due to traditional Belgian narratives we’re fed as kids. Dreaming big was seen in a negative light and discouraged. It was better to not try than to fail. I took on a job at a local dance school with a goal to save enough money to get out. \n\nAt 21 years old, I used my newly gained digital marketing skills to launch a YouTube channel that caught the eye of a local brand which sent me to Silicon Valley for 3 months.\n\nAt 22 years old, I knew that I didn’t have a visa or a fancy Ivy League education, so breaking into tech was gonna be tricky. That’s when I heard about this tech startup called Uber. \n\nI asked people for tours of Uber HQ, Facebook HQ, and secretly left messages on whiteboard to draw attention & hopefully score an interview. Got rejected twice, but tried a third time. \n\nSpoiler alert: I got the job! That’s how I landed my job. I bought my one-way ticket to San Francisco to join Uber as a social media manager.\n\nThat kickstarted my career in Marketing.\n\nToday, I’m SO excited to see how much easier it is for anyone with internet to connect with communities of like-minded people and tap into the growth mindset of successful people (e.g. Instagram communities, ClubHouse, Facebook groups, webinars, audiobooks, podcasts, personal brand newsletters).\n\nMY INTENTION:\n✔️ Take Clubhouse conversations “offline” & turn them into a professional circle of friends, collaborators, and mentor/mentee relationships\n\n✔️ Build connections with investors & within the world of VC \n\nHAPPY TO WEIGH IN ON: \n\n✔️ Marketing Strategies for creators and businesses + Personal Branding on social media\n✔️ Consciously using Social Media as a tool for meaningful connection or effective marketing for your business vs. an addiction or source of depression or a place for comparison \n\nSKILLS:\n\n✔️ Marketing & Growth Strategy\n✔️ Organic Marketing via Social Media\n✔️ Ghostwriting for personal brands\n✔️ Empathetic Leadership\n✔️ Listening & Embracing the Uncomfortable Conversations \n\nACTIVELY LEARNING:\n\n✔️ E-commerce marketing\n\n✔️ Personal Finance\n\n✔️ Fundraising",

The solution is a ground-breaking smart incliner that supports a user lying face-down prone and emulates the rocking motion of a mother calming her baby in her arms.",
